# R-For-Data-Science-Answers
An RMarkDown file and html output with my answers to Hadley Wickham's and Garrett Grolemund's questions from the book "R for Data Science" published by O'Reilly.

[Please purchase a copy of this excellent book](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399 "R For Data Science")

I go through and answer the questions as a means of learning the material.

This repository is intended for people whoe either care about how I think about data science and want to use my answers to questions as a means to understand that better, or for people who ***own*** a copy of the book and are curious as to what someone else answered.
